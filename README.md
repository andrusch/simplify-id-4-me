# Simplify Identity For Us

This project represents patterns regardless of the platform to help simplify identity concepts for anyone.
We believe if the ways identities move through the internet are well understood by everyone who creates
technology, we could change the world, enabling a new wave of self-empowered privacy and security
with great standards and support. This site aims to help someone first get started with certain
patterns to achieve quick success and understanding.
